		<h2><span style="color:#fff">Call for Late Breaking Work</span></h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Call for Late Break Work at IndiaHCI2019!
This platform aims to provide researchers and students with the opportunity to elicit feedback on early-stage work, discuss new research ideas relevant to the broad themes of the conference, as well as seek collaborators for taking successful projects to completion.
</p>

			<p>An LBW submission is different from other contribution types. It represents work that has not reached a level of completion that would warrant a full refereed selection process. Summaries of completed work or reduced versions of short or full paper submissions are inappropriate as an LBW submission. Only submissions that make a meaningful contribution to the body of HCI knowledge or practice of interaction design will be of interest to the conference participants and will hence be accepted for presentation. A significant benefit of LBW is the discussion between the author and participants by face-to-face presentation of the work.
</p>

			<p>LBW submissions should report innovative, original work that has not been published previously. While the posters and videos of accepted submissions will be publicly presented at the conference and on the web, LBW work will not be deemed as “published”. Authors will retain the copyrights of their work, and the option to continue working on the topic and to publish the completed work at a future venue.
</p>
<p>
 Accepted submissions must be presented at the conference. At least one and preferably all authors for an accepted LBW submission must register for the conference by (date) for the submission to be included in the conference programme. 
</p>

	

			<h3>Submission Format</h3>

			<p>An LBW submissions must consist of three things:
        
        <ul>
          <li>A 100-word abstract describing the contribution</li>
          <li>An A1 size poster submitted as a PDF file in the review system. The poster should be complete, well-designed and thoroughly copy-edited. It should not be anonymous.</li>
          <li>A 2-minute video in MP4 format uploaded in a publicly and anonymously accessible location such as Google Drive or Dropbox.</li>
        </ul>
          </p>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>

      <p>These submissions should communicate:
        
        <ul>
          <li>A concise description of the work</li>
          <li>Implications of the work for the India HCI community</li>
          <li>Plans for further investigation and/or incorporation into practice</li>
        </ul>
          </p>

<h3>Review Process</h3>

      <p>LBW submissions will be peer-reviewed by a panel of experts. The reviewers will take into consideration the early-stage nature of the work and its potential to generate a discussion at the conference. All submissions will be considered confidential during the review process. Due to the short review cycle, LBW submissions will be reviewed as if there would be no changes between the submission and the final document to be included in the conference website. </p>
      <p>
        Accepted videos will be presented on the India HCI Youtube channel. Accepted posters will be presented during the conference. Authors will be expected to attend the conference and will be assigned a time to present their poster to conference participants. Authors will be required to set up beforehand and stand with their posters during the assigned time.
