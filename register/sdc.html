        <h2><span style="color:#fff">Student Design Competition</span></h2>


<p>Welcome to the Student Design Competition!
<br> 
<p>This competition provides students with an opportunity to display their abilities in problem solving and innovative thinking in a national competition. It is also a podium for interactions between future professionals in HCI, the attendees of the conference, and also the current experts in the field.
</p>

<p>The tracks for SDC 2019, in line with the broad themes of IndiaHCI2019 “Agents and Agency, HCI in the Age of Machine Intelligence” are (suggestions, same as before, can be chosen from): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Explainable and explorable AI</li>
  <li>Human intelligence in Machine intelligenc</li>
  <li>Methodological challenges </li>
  <li>Ethics for research and application in AI</li>
  <li>Design processes for HCI with AI</li>
  <li>Philosophical enquiry of the field</li>
  <li>Critical Views of AI</li>
  <li>Agents and Human Interaction</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Models for Human-Agent Interaction</li>
    <li>Social Agents and Emotional Interaction</li>
    <li>Agent based Human-Computer Interaction</li>
    <li>Human Cooperation and Agent-based Interaction</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this panel is broad. We encourage researchers to engage with participatory design or co-creation approaches to evaluate current research, or engage with upcoming developments in technology in modelling the relationship between machine intelligence and human agency, such as 3D printing, digital fabrication, citizen sensing, the maker movement, AR, VR, AI, machine learning, IoT, new sensors, and actuators. 
We also encourage researchers to think beyond the existing solutions, and try to imagine innovative solutions to the problems proposed by our two tracks.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>For this year’s design challenge, the following are the evaluation criteria:
  <ul>
    <li>Does the design intervention address a real need?</li>
    <li>Does the design intervention aligns with the design brief/theme?</li>
    <li>Does the intervention use technology in an appropriate and novel way?</li>
    <li>Were analysis, synthesis, design and evaluation both systematic and sufficient?</li>
    <li>Was the intervention developed far enough to demonstrate the key ideas?</li>
    <li>Did the team explore the entire ecosystem of stakeholders, conditions, and contexts?</li>
    <li>Was the intervention well-crafted and effectively presented?</li>
  </ul>

  We look forward to seeing your submissions.
</p>




<h3>Eligibility Criteria for Teams</h3>
<p>The following criteria need to be met for teams to be eligible:
   <ul>
    <li>Teams must consist of at least two, but no more than five students.</li>
    <li>There is no limit to the number of teams that may compete from any given University or organization.</li>
    <li>However, one student cannot be part of multiple teams.</li>
  </ul>
    Submissions are invited from all students at all stages of their university careers, from undergraduate to postgraduate studies.
</p>

 <p>
        Submissions will be taken using the Easy Chair system.

The submission must have the following FOUR components:
      </p>
      <p><b>Extended Abstract:</b>  Submit a non-anonymized paper (6 pages maximum) written in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format (Download the right template from: https://sigchi.org/templates/) summarizing their design solution and its evolution. Submissions not meeting the page limit or formatting requirements will be automatically disqualified. This document should be submitted as a single PDF and the file must be no larger than 10 Mb in size.</p>

    <p><b>Poster:</b>  The poster design should be reduced to one standard letter page in size and submitted in PDF format and the file must be no larger than 10 Mb in size.
</p>

  <p><b>Video:</b>  Teams must provide a supplementary video (MP4 file, max 5-minutes), with a file-size no larger than 100Mb, illustrating how your solution fits the lives of the users with the help of scenarios. It may also illustrate some details of the interface and the information presented.
</p>

   <p><b>Proof of Student Status:</b>  submit a note signed by your academic supervisor/head of school verifying the following:

</p>

 <p><b>Your university:</b>  Whether you and your team are graduate or undergraduate students

</p>

<h3>Evaluation/Review Process</h3>
<p>
  Each submitted student project will be reviewed by academic and/or professional experts in interaction design. Nominees and award winners will be selected based on the following criteria:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Originality</li>
    <li>Quality</li>
    <li>Relevance to key theme</li>
    <li>Relevance to the broader theme of IndiaHCI2019</li>
  </ul>
<!--
<p>The first category: <b> Healthcare and wellness beyond the screen</b><br>
And the second category: <b> Education beyond the screen</b></p>

<p>In the spirit of the theme of IndiaHCI 2018 “Beyond and Behind the Screen”, for this Student Design Competition, we encourage you to contribute to the two categories as listed above. To elaborate, use human-centred design approaches to develop new ways to either: <br>
a) motivate, support, and enrich active lifestyle among citizens OR  <br>
b) identify and promote new way of learning. </p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this brief is broad.<br> 
Health & Wellness: For example, you could focus on healthcare, ageing, different age groups, sustainable living, food and nutrition, sports and exercise, just to name a few. 
Education: Your solution might aim to support primary education, university education, different mode of education, etc. </p>

<p>You may come up with a participatory design and co-creation approach using existing technologies or you may find opportunity in contemporary developments in technology, such as 3D printing, digital fabrication, citizen sensing, the maker movement, AR, VR, AI, machine learning, IoT, new sensors and actuators to name just a few. <br>
<i><b>However, we are not encouraging design ideas around traditional screen-based solutions such as smartphone based apps for learning or fitness. We encourage students to think beyond the traditional boundaries of digital screens, and imagine new way of supporting education and healthcare.</b></i></p>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>For this year’s design challenge, the following are the evaluation criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does the design intervention address a real need?
    <li>Does the design intervention aligns with the design brief/theme? 
    <li>Does the intervention use technology in an appropriate and novel way?
    <li>Were analysis, synthesis, design and evaluation both systematic and sufficient?
    <li>Was the intervention developed far enough to demonstrate the key ideas?
    <li>Did the team explore the entire ecosystem of stakeholders, conditions, and contexts?
    <li>Was the intervention well-crafted and effectively presented?
</ul>

<p>We look forward to seeing your submissions.</p>

<h3>Student team requirements</h3>
