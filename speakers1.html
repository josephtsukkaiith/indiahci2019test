<p>Talk Title:<b> Being human: a lived experience of 30 years of Human Computer Interaction</b><p> Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has always been concerned with designing technologies from a people-centred perspective. However what this means has changed radically over the years - each new technology wave brings different challenges for interpreting what aspects of H (human), C (computer) and I (interaction) matter. Reflecting on 30 years personal experience as an HCI student/researcher, user experience consultant, and academic, what becomes clear is that technology is now increasingly entangled in being human and shaping the society we live in. This puts enormous responsibility on us to be responsible HCI practitioners, reflective in our role shaping human futures.</p>

<p>Talk Title:<b> Empathy, Participation, Accountability, or Solidarity? </b><p> HCI research, like design more broadly, often appeals to improvement, empowerment, and the good — not only for ourselves but for others. HCI talks most about users, but the technologies we help imagine and create implicate people in many ways: as bystanders, as targets, as data bodies, and as workers, just to begin. In this talk, I draw on a decade of work designing with workers in the context of Amazon Mechanical Turk, studying design practices in depth in development, and working with technology activists to resist the business of war. I reflect on the working relationships, outcomes, dramas, and failures of these collective projects draw out lessons in how HCI might more vigorously and responsibly shape the futures of technology. I explore empathy, participation, accountability, and solidarity as alternative ethics of how we guide our design and HCI work in the world.</p>

<p>Talk Title:<b>"Fellow-creatures, colleagues, dangerous equals”: Designing with, and for, the more-than-human"</b><p> We live in a world where an estimated 3 billion people cook and heat their homes with simple
technologies using wood, animal dung, and coal. We also work in a technology-driven industry that is creating a demand for energy that, in the next 20 or so years, is predicted to exceed current global production. Under these circumstances, is human-centred design our best path forward? Designing with, and for, the more-than-human aims to recognise and respect humanity’s deep interdependence with other animals, plants, materials, and forces of the earth. This requires design researchers to re-imagine our
relations with others, re-assess our values, and re-evaluate our practices. Drawing on a decade of research and teaching in multispecies ethnography and speculative design, I will outline what is at stake in refusing to treat the world as a resource for our wildest desires and instead treat it as a partner in our most hopeful dreams.</p>

<p>Talk Title: <b>Future trends in HCI – Creating leadership roles for Designers ‘behind’ and ‘beyond’
the ‘screen’.</b><p>In the year 2000 not much was heard or known about HCI in India especially in Design
schools. The term Interaction design became the ‘front end’ much later after creative
designers graduating out of Design schools, led User Experience Design teams in the
Computing and Information Communication (ICT) industrial sector. Even as of today in
2018 there exists unresolved confusing boundaries between Graphical Interfaces
designing (GUI) and User Experience design (UX) resulting in designer’s self-imposed
spheres of influence such as the ‘screen’. As Knowledge silos in HCI continue to dissolve
due to rapid technological innovation all over the world, a question arises in the minds of
designers as to where do the boundaries for a creative designer start and end in terms of
knowledge acquisition and skills required in HCI ? What knowledge is to be acquired and
what is to be focused upon? Will Interface and Interaction Designers define their boundaries
or will other knowledge domains such as Computer Science and ICT set the limits for
Designers? ‘HCI’ - ‘Human Computer Interaction’ has evolved this decade into ‘Human
Centered Interaction’ and is now trending towards ‘Human Computer Integration’. This
keynote address will attempt to see into the near future by tracing ongoing trends in Design
research. It will argue for a transdisciplinary approach. It will cite case examples including
the emergence of AI, IOT, and Cognitive Science in an attempt to understand what all this
means to Designers on the threshold of a career in HCI- UI- IxD. Technological advances,
as already predicted are redefining boundaries requiring Designers themselves to resolve
and go behind the screen. Will Artificially Intelligent avatars; Internet of Things and such
other computational advances replace our jobs as Designers? This presentation will argue
for changes that may have to be adopted in Design learning and skilling if Designers have
to continue to remain in the forefront in order to engineer Usability into ubiquitous systems
so as to transfer real User Experience into the virtual world thereby augmenting quality of
life in the real world.</p>

<p>Talk Title:<b>"Seeing beyond the screen - reflections on crafting technology for the art of change "</b><p> As connectivity and computing expand their geographies, human life on the planet is recast. Post-human thinkers offer theoretical points of departure to understand what this means, and feminist political thinkers underscore how the quest for humanity is to recover the idea of becoming humane. Wired space ironically, may still be disconnected, and open arenas of exchange, highly exclusionary. The challenge for development practitioners and indeed, socially conscious designers, is to be able to intervene towards the idea of a humane society. The end may well be unattainable, but it still offers a compass. I will focus my presentation on one decade of learning from Prakriye, IT for Change's field centre, that works with socially and economically marginalised women and girls. I will attempt to answer the question, what does it mean to design techno-social interventions for emancipation? </p>

          <p>Talk Title: <b>Computational Wavefront Manipulation for Novel User-Interfaces</b></p>
          <p>One of the visions on my research group is to deliver novel visual and tactile experiences to users without instrumenting them with wearable or head-mounted displays.We achieve this by using ultrasonic speaker arrays and acoustic metamaterials to manipulate acoustic wavefronts that create haptic feedback and levitation based displays. For example, Ultrahaptics is our haptic feedback system uses ultrasonic speaker arrays to create tactile stimulations in multiple locations of the hand. This feedback is created in mid-air – so users don’t have to touch or hold any device to experience it. In this talk, I will present some of our recent projects on this topic and conclude with the use of acoustic radiation forces to create displays based on levitation.</p>
